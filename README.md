# Are You Psychic?

Can You guess what letter the computer is thinking of?

# How it works

When each round begins, the computer will choose a random letter from a-z. The user will then type keys to try to guess the letter. If the letter is guessed within ten tries, then the user wins; otherwise, they lose.

Also, I implemented a way for the game to be played on mobile devices by use of a textbox, which will allow the keyboard to appear and input guesses.

# Technology Used
HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, SweetAlert), JavaScript
